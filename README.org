* dotfiles

Just my dotfiles. Mostly my [[./emacs.d][emacs.d]]. Some of this is my own, a lot is inspired
by or taken from others' config/scripts and adapted to my needs. Probably kind
of a mess at the moment.

This is a largely org-mode (and therefore emacs) based dotfiles configuration.
Most short or one-off configuration files and scripts are directly tangled to
the apropriate location from [[./rc.org][rc.org]] using an asynchronous call to
~org-babel-tangle-file~ on save.

Since my [[./emacs.d/config.org][emacs configuration]] is much more complex, it is kept in its own org
file and the =emacs.d= directory is symlinked. The vim directory is also
symlinked.
