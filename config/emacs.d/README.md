# .emacs.d
- Absolutely not a place anyone should be looking for advice or proper setup.
- Somewhere to keep my .emacs.d folder, which right now is mostly just an init.el file.
- Corrections, suggestions, and scolds are welcome.
- Seriously, I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing (and you can probably tell), but I'm working on it.
