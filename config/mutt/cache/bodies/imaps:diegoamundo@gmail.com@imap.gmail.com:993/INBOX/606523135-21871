Human Missions to Mars Will Look Completely Different from "The Martian"

The Sciences
The blockbuster film=E2=80=99s futuristic vision of interplanetary explorati=
on could soon be out of date

By Lee Billings | October 2, 2015
=E2=80=A2=E2=80=A2

=20
Landing in US theaters today, Ridley Scott=E2=80=99s The Martian is being ac=
claimed as one of the most realistic portrayals of human space exploration e=
ver filmed. Based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, the film stars Matt Damon a=
s Mark Watney, a wisecracking botanist-turned-astronaut marooned on Mars aft=
er being accidentally left behind by his crewmates. Faced with extremely lim=
ited food and supplies, and with any hope of rescue more than a year and mil=
lions of kilometers away, early on Watney lays out his stark options for sub=
sistence in the film=E2=80=99s most memorable line of dialogue: Either =E2=80=
=9Cscience the shit out of this,=E2=80=9D or die.

Incidentally, it=E2=80=99s not really science that Watney uses to survive=E2=
=80=94it=E2=80=99s engineering. But whatever you call it, the result is a wo=
nderfully entertaining and reasonably accurate portrayal of how to live off t=
he land=E2=80=94even when that land is on a freeze-dried alien planet.

As NASA workers struggle to launch a mission to bring him back home, Watney i=
mprovises one ingenious scheme after another to stay alive. He turns his hab=
itat into a chemistry lab and a greenhouse, extracting potable water from ro=
cket fuel and growing potatoes in nutrient-poor Martian soil fertilized with=
 his own feces. He repairs spacesuit breaches and blown-out airlocks with du=
ct tape. He even jury-rigs his own long-haul vehicle powered by solar batter=
ies and warmed with radioactive plutonium, then treks to the landing site of=
 NASA=E2=80=99s real-life Pathfinder rover to reactivate its radio and reest=
ablish communications with Earth.

There are several small inaccuracies in both Weir=E2=80=99s book and Scott=E2=
=80=99s film. The wind from a dust storm that initially strands the astronau=
t on Mars would in reality barely ripple a flag, because the Martian atmosph=
ere is so thin. Instead of extracting water from rocket fuel, a real-life Wa=
tney might mine and purify water from deposits of ice thought to exist benea=
th the soil across large swaths of the planet. And because Mars=E2=80=99 atm=
osphere and magnetic field are too insubstantial to shield against cosmic ra=
diation, Watney=E2=80=99s skittishness about warming himself with heavily sh=
ielded plutonium is misguided=E2=80=94in fact, most of his radiation exposur=
e would come from simply walking around outside in his spacesuit.

But these are minor technical quibbles. The Martian=E2=80=99s greater diverg=
ences from reality are less about science, and more about technology and pol=
itics. The key question to ask about The Martian=E2=80=99s accuracy is this:=
 Would Watney=E2=80=94or anyone else=E2=80=94even be on Mars in the first pl=
ace for the story to unfold?

Neither the book nor the movie explicitly say when exactly the story takes p=
lace, but Weir (as well as clever readers who reverse-engineered the book=E2=
=80=99s timeline) has revealed that Watney and his crewmates land on Mars in=
 November 2035. They get there via a four-month voyage in a very large, very=
 expensive interplanetary shuttle that cycles crews back and forth between M=
ars and Earth. The shuttle also spins to provide artificial gravity to its o=
ccupants, to protect them from the wasting caused by extended stays in zero g=
ravity. Furthermore, Watney=E2=80=99s mission is actually the third human la=
nding on Mars, preceded by two landings earlier in the 2030s.

All this seems to mesh with NASA=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CJourney to Mars=E2=80=9D=
 program, which aims to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. But a closer l=
ook at NASA=E2=80=99s program reveals potential problems. Despite its scient=
ific and technical accuracy, The Martian seems to take place in a fairy-tale=
 world where NASA possesses much more political power=E2=80=94and has a far l=
arger share of the federal budget than its current meager 0.4 percent.

NASA has no plans for a large, spinning cycler spacecraft between Earth and M=
ars, probably because such a spacecraft is considered unaffordable. In fact,=
 ongoing squabbles in Washington over how to divvy up NASA=E2=80=99s persist=
ently flat budget means that essentially all the crucial components for the a=
gency=E2=80=99s planned voyages=E2=80=94the heavy-lift rockets, the power so=
urces, engines and spacecraft for deep space, the landers, surface habitats a=
nd ascent vehicles=E2=80=94are behind schedule and still in early stages of d=
evelopment, if they are being developed at all. And the agency=E2=80=99s Jou=
rney to Mars could all go away, very quickly, at the whim of some future Pre=
sident or Congressional majority. Mired in the muck of politics, NASA may no=
t manage to land even one crew of astronauts on Mars by 2035=E2=80=94let alo=
ne three.

Then again, by the 2030s, there may be good reasons to avoid landing on Mars=
. The search for extraterrestrial life is arguably the most powerful motivat=
ion for sending humans to Mars=E2=80=94but also the very thing that could sc=
uttle such missions. This week=E2=80=99s announcement from NASA confirming t=
ransient flows of liquid water on present-day Mars is fueling a debate over w=
hether humans could visit the Red Planet=E2=80=99s most tantalizing and habi=
table regions without spoiling them. Earthly microbes have already hitchhike=
d on several robotic interplanetary voyages due to our less-than-perfect spa=
cecraft sterilization techniques, carrying with them the risk of contaminati=
ng or destroying any native ecosystems where they land.

If rare, tenacious microbes on a robot are a problem, then the trillions liv=
ing within each and every human explorer would be a far greater worry. A new=
 report released last week from the National Academy of Sciences says such =E2=
=80=9Cplanetary protection=E2=80=9D concerns could limit human landings to t=
he parts of Mars considered least likely to hold life. Those regions, it mus=
t be said, are shrinking as satellite imagery and robotic landers reveal eve=
r-larger portions of the Martian environment as more hospitable than previou=
sly believed. If respected, such restrictions could make the politicians con=
trolling NASA=E2=80=99s budget wonder why we should bother sending humans to=
 Mars at all.

One provisional solution to the problems of budgets and contamination, offer=
ed in a second report released this week by the Planetary Society, is to sen=
d humans not to Mars itself in the 2030s, but rather to its moons, the 20-ki=
lometer-wide Phobos and its half-sized sibling, Deimos. Both moons are easy t=
o visit because of their low surface gravities, and they are most likely lit=
tered with ancient debris that asteroid impacts blasted into orbit from the M=
artian surface. After those lunar sorties in the 2030s, humans might at last=
 descend to Mars at the end of that decade and in the 2040s.

Because it defers the expensive, slow development of new technologies for la=
nding and living on Mars, the plan could be cheaper and easier for NASA to a=
ccomplish by the 2030s within the constraints of its projected budget. And i=
t would allow more time to solve the difficult problems of planetary protect=
ion=E2=80=94either through improved methods for quarantining humans on the s=
urface, or, more ambitiously, through the use of advanced telerobotics. The r=
ound-trip lag time for messages between researchers on Earth and rovers on M=
ars averages around 20 minutes, limiting the efficiency, flexibility, and sp=
eed of exploration. The two-way communication time between Mars and its moon=
 Phobos is just 40 milliseconds, making it possible to use entirely new clas=
ses of robotic explorers that have never before been deployed on other plane=
ts.

Instead of being stranded on Mars, by 2035 an astronaut like Watney might mo=
re realistically be found on a moon overhead, virtually exploring the Red Pl=
anet with remote-controlled robots that scale cliffs, spelunk into caverns, b=
urrow into the ground and fly through the air. In time, The Martian=E2=80=99=
s portrayal of microbe-riddled astronauts huffing and puffing around Mars in=
 bulky spacesuits may seem quaint. For now, go check out the film=E2=80=94it=
=E2=80=99s the closest most of us will ever get to Mars for a long time. Whi=
ch might not be a bad thing.

a href=3D"http://www.nap.edu/catalog/21816/review-of-the-mepag-report-on-mar=
s-special-regions">new report</a> released last week from the National Acade=
my of Sciences says such =E2=80=9Cplanetary protection=E2=80=9D concerns cou=
ld limit human landings to the parts of Mars considered least likely to hold=
 life. Those regions, it must be said, are shrinking as satellite imagery an=
d robotic landers reveal ever-larger portions of the Martian environment as m=
ore hospitable than previously believed. If respected, such restrictions cou=
ld make the politicians controlling NASA=E2=80=99s budget wonder why we shou=
ld bother sending humans to Mars at all.</p>
<p>One provisional solution to the problems of budgets and contamination, of=
fered in a second <a href=3D"http://hom.planetary.org/">report</a> released t=
his week by the Planetary Society, is to send humans not to Mars itself in t=
he 2030s, but rather to its moons, the 20-kilometer-wide Phobos and its half=
-sized sibling, Deimos. Both moons are easy to visit because of their low su=
rface gravities, and they are most likely littered with ancient debris that a=
steroid impacts blasted into orbit from the Martian surface. After those lun=
ar sorties in the 2030s, humans might at last descend to Mars at the end of t=
hat decade and in the 2040s.</p>
<p>Because it defers the expensive, slow development of new technologies for=
 landing and living on Mars, the plan could be cheaper and easier for NASA t=
o accomplish by the 2030s within the constraints of its projected budget. An=
d it would allow more time to solve the difficult problems of planetary prot=
ection=E2=80=94either through improved methods for quarantining humans on th=
e surface, or, more ambitiously, through the use of advanced telerobotics. T=
he round-trip lag time for messages between researchers on Earth and rovers o=
n Mars averages around 20 minutes, limiting the efficiency, flexibility, and=
 speed of exploration. The two-way communication time between Mars and its m=
oon Phobos is just 40 milliseconds, making it possible to use entirely new c=
lasses of robotic explorers that have never before been deployed on other pl=
anets.</p>
<p>Instead of being stranded on Mars, by 2035 an astronaut like Watney might=
 more realistically be found on a moon overhead, virtually exploring the Red=
 Planet with remote-controlled robots that scale cliffs, spelunk into cavern=
s, burrow into the ground and fly through the air. In time, <em>The Martian<=
/em>=E2=80=99s portrayal of microbe-riddled astronauts huffing and puffing a=
round Mars in bulky spacesuits may seem quaint. For now, go check out the fi=
lm=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s the closest most of us will ever get to Mars for a l=
