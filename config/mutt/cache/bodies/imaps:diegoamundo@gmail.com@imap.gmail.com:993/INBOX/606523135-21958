Martian Astronaut Would Get Cancer If Mission Were Real, Author Says

Tech
No extant technology exists to protect a traveler from the potentially deadl=
y doses of radiation on Mars

=E2=80=A2=E2=80=A2

=20
In the newly released The Martian, a stranded astronaut must figure out how t=
o survive on the Red Planet after being accidentally left behind when the re=
st of his crew escapes a violent dust storm. Explorer Mark Watney spends man=
y months trying to make water, grow food and send an SOS signal back to Eart=
h. Most of the tools he uses in the film, which opened Oct. 2, are based on e=
xisting or in-development technology. The one major exception is the radiati=
on-blocking material that allows Watney to spend much of his days outside hi=
s habitat, on the surface of a planet that lacks Earth=E2=80=99s atmosphere a=
nd is thus bathed in significantly higher levels of damaging radiation.

=E2=80=9CIn the book they have this really thin, light, flexible material th=
at blocks all radiation,=E2=80=9D says Andy Weir, author of the book The Mar=
tian on which the film was based. =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s nothing even remo=
tely like that in the real world. That was the magic I gave him so the story=
 would progress. Otherwise Mark would have different kinds of cancer.=E2=80=9D=


Scientists differ on how dangerous the radiation levels on Mars would actual=
ly be for future explorers. The first on-the-ground radiation measurements c=
ame from NASA=E2=80=99s Curiosity rover in 2013, which suggested that astron=
auts who spent a year traveling to and from Mars and 500 days on the surface=
 would receive a radiation dose of about one Sievert, equivalent to a roughl=
y five percent increased lifetime risk of cancer compared to a lifetime of e=
xposure back on Earth. NASA currently limits astronauts to no more than a th=
ree percent increased risk of developing cancer compared to the general popu=
lation=E2=80=94after they reach this amount of cumulative radiation, they=E2=
=80=99re grounded. The space agency, however, is forging ahead with plans to=
 send crews to Mars by the 2030s; among the technologies high on its list to=
 develop for a Martian mission is better radiation shielding.

Scientific American spoke to Weir about the plausibility of a real-life miss=
ion to Mars, the prospect of space hotels and why he would never want to tra=
vel to the Red Planet himself. An edited version of the conversation is belo=
w.

How much of the technology Watney uses in the book and movie actually exists=
?

Pretty much all of it exists. The radiation shielding was the one magical te=
chnology I granted them. But otherwise all the technology is either current o=
r scaled-up versions of what exists today.

Do you think humans will ever reach Mars?

Absolutely. The only question is when. But despite how I portray the mission=
s in the book, I think the first manned mission will probably be a [multinat=
ional] effort like the International Space Station.

I suspect we lack the political will to send a manned mission to Mars right n=
ow. The money is not there, and NASA isn=E2=80=99t as well-funded as they us=
ed to be, but I don=E2=80=99t have any doubt that we will eventually get the=
re. I=E2=80=99d like it happen during my lifetime but if it doesn=E2=80=99t,=
 oh well. I=E2=80=99m just a little drop in the bucket when it comes to huma=
n history.

In The Martian, China=E2=80=99s space agency plays an important part in atte=
mpts to save Mark Watney. Do you think the Chinese might be the first to sen=
d people to Mars?

No. They are certainly capable, but I also question whether they have the po=
litical will to spend that much money. I do strongly suspect that by the tim=
e we go to Mars we=E2=80=99ll be cooperating with China.

Commercial space companies don=E2=80=99t feature much in the story. Do you t=
hink they=E2=80=99ll be a major force in getting to Mars?

Absolutely=E2=80=94commercial spaceflight is crucial. Companies like SpaceX s=
ay they want to drive the price down, and are vigilantly working to reduce t=
he cost to get things into Earth orbit. That motivation is what will ultimat=
ely allow us to expand into our solar system.

Imagine if you could go up into space and spend a week at a space hotel for a=
bout $50,000. It would be once-in-a-lifetime trip, but a lot of middle-class=
 Americans would do that. Suddenly, there=E2=80=99d be this huge market for i=
t and that would cause even more competition in the industry and drive price=
s further down. We=E2=80=99re just at the cusp of a space boom, I think.

If this future comes to pass, would you want to go to Mars?

Oh hell no. I write about brave people. I=E2=80=99m not one of them. I have a=
 fear of flying!
